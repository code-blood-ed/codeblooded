                <h2 class="package__subtitle">Lets get started then...</h2>
                <p class="package__info">
                     Hi there, I'm just a boy next door who's good in academics and is well behaved and 
                    don't do fun stuffs, who's always busy in studies and don't have a life.
                    Well, that's what my parents think of me.I'm kinda opposite. A fun guy, who loves to hangout with his friends,
                    who studies at the last momement(one night before exams),who's always ready to bunk classes
                    and a complete tech freak.<br/><br/>
                    
                    Hobbies... can you mention some of yours? I guess you can, but trust me I can't 'cause i don't have a list like 
                    these are the things that i consider as my hobbies. But there are few things that i really enjoy.
                    I like to go on bike rides when the moon is at its fullest, when the Wind is there to cheer me up 
                    and my earphones... my earphones plugged in and my favourite song on repeat,(don't expect much i'm not a Poet) ofcourse a soothing one.
                    But what will you need after such a refreshing ride? A god damn sleep.Sleep...its been 
                    a long time that i've used the term "Sleep", I call it my one true love.<br/><br/>

                    I would like to keep this section kinda short, 'cause I don't have much friends. BUT a lot
                    to mention about the ones i've and even more than a lot of stories which are worth narrating,some other day maybe?
                </p>

                <h1 class="package__title">Life was different before joining S-I-S-T!</h1>
                <!-- <h2 class="package__badge">Here you are!</h2> -->
                <h2 class="package__subtitle">A completely different me.</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;" class="package__info">While eveyone were busy making dalgona coffee and learning new things. I was busy sleeping.
                    Everyone gained some weight, and me, ah..I think i'm from those 10% who actually lost some.
                    Some utilised the lockdown period, for some it went like a holdiay, some were busy with their 
                    online office work and me... I was busy protecting my teammates,landing in Military Island,collecting
                    weapons and leading my team to a glorious victory, ya i was busy playing PUBG which eventually got banned,
                    BAD MOVE GOV! <br/><br/>
                    
                    There are specific phases in everyone's life that they can't forget ...For me it was my admission phase.
                    After "Utilising" my lockdown, my JEE went "very well".
                    I really wanted to get admitted to VIT Vellore, but my ranking didn't helped me,
                    i was given ECE in VIT Vellore, i was about to confirm my seat there, but something stopped me,
                    rememeber "Tech-Freak"? I can't compromise my branch, CSE does matter to me. Here comes SIST.
                    Sathyabama Insitute of Science and Technology, 
                    SIST was my second choice and here i am.<br/><br/>
                    
                    I was the only one from my group who took admission this year, all my friends have taken a year drop.
                    I'm still in touch with them but you know, the frequency has decreased, they're busy preparing
                    and me... no i'm not at all busy lol! <br/><br/>
                    You rememeber that famous line by Thanos? "Perfectly balanced as all things should be"
                    I got connected with an old friend of mine through LinkedIn(LinkedIn is important!) and got to know one or two more peeps,
                    which are now my close friends. So yeah, everything is perfectly balanced.</p>

                <h2 class="package__subtitle">Here starts MY NEW LIFE...</h2>
                <p class="package__info">Wake up! Wake up Akarsh, you've classes, well thats how my day starts. Mumma waking me up and i keep on irritating her by 
                    "let me sleep for just 5 more mins". <br/>

                    Online classes has many advantages and the top most advantage is "Online Examination", you know what i mean right?
                    We can easily score good grades.But it has some disadvantages too.<br/><br/>
                    Being Freshers we don't know anybody unless you took admission along with your friends.
                    I was worried that how can i make friends, am i gonna be alone in this online thing but i was wrong.
                    As the official group was created, someone sent a link of unofficial group for students, i jumped over there 
                    and everyone was tallking in Tamil, i couldn't understand anything but atleast i can get notes now.
                    But i was wrong again... a guy texted me and then wooshhh i got my friend in SIST, through him
                    i got to know another guy who's now one of my close friends and with passing days, now i've group of selected peeps
                    on whom i can rely on. The group is like, "All for one and one for all!".<br/><br/>
                    Every college has clubs, photography club, english club, dancing and singing club and many more.
                    But i'm not interested in any of them and here comes DSC... Developers' Students' Club
                    The club is as great as its name is, we went through few rounds of recruitment and guess what? 
                    I made it. In a surrounding where evryone was bursting crackers and having new year party, i was refreshing my mail for their response 
                    and at sharp 00:00. A new mail popped "Congratulations Akarsh! You made it".
                    A great start for a new year. I got connected with few other talented peeps and now <br/><br/>
                    
                   <strong> here i'm...in SIST...happy...coding...dedicated towards my goal and finishing my Webpage although i've my practicals tommorow!</strong> </p>
